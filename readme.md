[!WARNING] Under construction. Coming soon.

## Setup

I am running this tutorial on a Mac using Orbstack, which helps to run end-to-end authentically without incurring a cloud bill.

1. Install homebrew at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).
1. Install `helm` and `orbstack` and a few other things.
    ```
    brew instal helm orbstack openssl openjdk kafka
    ```
    [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes.

    [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) is a management system for containers and Linux VMs that makes it convenient to run Kubernetes locally, among other things.

    Openjdk is a Java runtime. This is required to use the `keytool` command to generate keystores and truststore for certificates. You may need to add it to your `PATH` in your shell profile for the shell to properly locate and execute the program. For example, add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` profile:
    ```bash
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"
    ```

## Prepare Certificates

This example will generate certificates that will be used by Kafka brokers and Gateway instances to establish secure connections using TLS.

This example will use TLS (formerly known as SSL) to encrypt data in transit between:
- between Kafka clients and Conduktor Gateway
- between Conduktor Gateway and Kafka

1. Run the following script to generate the keystores and truststore.

    ```bash
    ./generate-tls.sh
    ```

1. Inspect the certificates for various services. For example, inspect the gateway certificate.
    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in ./certs/gateway-ca1-signed.crt -text -noout
    ```
    **IMPORTANT:** Notice the Subject Alternate Names (SAN) that allow Gateway to present various hostnames to the client. This is crucial for hostname-based routing, also known as Server Name Indication (SNI) routing. Gateway can present a different hostname for each Kafka broker, which makes it possible to route Kafka client traffic through to the correct broker based solely on hostname rather than requiring a separate Gateway port per broker.


1. (Optional) Inspect the `generate-tls.sh` script to see how it
    - Creates a certificate authority (CA)
    - Creates a CA cert
    - Uses the CA cert to create service certificates for Kafka and Conduktor Gateway
    - Constructs Subject Alternate Names (SANs) to allow Gateway to present to clients as any broker.
    - Creates a truststore that clients can use to validate the identity of any service's certificate that has been signed by the CA



## Deploy

Deploy Kafka and Gateway.

```bash
./start.sh
```

A lot happens here:
- Create shared namespace `conduktor`
- Create kubernetes secrets for Kafka
- Create kubernetes secrets for Gateway
- Install Kafka via Bitnami's Kafka helm chart
- Install Gateway via Conduktor's helm chart
- Install `ingress-nginx` Ingress Controller
- Create Ingress for Gateway


## Connect

In newer JDKs, Java clients need to run with this env var set (see [KIP 1006](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1006%3A+Remove+SecurityManager+Support)):
```bash
export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.manager=allow"
```
You can also add ` -Djavax.net.debug=ssl` to enable ssl debug messages.

Look at metadata returned by Kafka.

```bash
kafka-broker-api-versions \
    --bootstrap-server franz-kafka.conduktor.svc.cluster.local:9092 \
    --command-config client.properties
```

Look at metadata returned by Gateway.

```bash
kafka-broker-api-versions \
    --bootstrap-server franz-kafka.conduktor.svc.cluster.local:9092 \
    --command-config client.properties
```

Create a topic (going through Gateway).

```bash
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
    --create --topic test --partitions 6 \
    --command-config client.properties
```

List topics (directly from Kafka).

```bash
kafka-topics --list \
  --bootstrap-server franz-kafka.conduktor.svc.cluster.local:9092 \
  --command-config client.properties
```

List topics (going through Gateway).

```bash
kafka-topics --list \
  --bootstrap-server gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
  --command-config client.properties
```

Produce to the topic (going through Gateway).

```bash
echo "hello" | kafka-console-producer --topic test \
  --bootstrap-server gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
  --producer.config client.properties
```

Consume from the topic (going through Gateway).

```bash
kafka-console-consumer --topic test --from-beginning \
  --bootstrap-server gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
  --consumer.config client.properties
```


## Takeaways

- Your Ingress Controller must support **layer 4 routing** (TCP, not HTTP) with **TLS-passthrough**.
    - For AWS EKS this would mean using the Load Balancer Controller with Network Load Balancer (NLB).
    - TLS passthrough is required so that Gateway can use the SNI headers in the TLS handshake to route requests to specific brokers. 
- Your client must be able to resolve all hosts advertised by Gateway to the external load balancer. In this example, OrbStack magically points all `*.k8s.orb.local` to the ingress-nginx Ingress Controller, and the Ingress we defined points these hosts to the `gateway-external` service:
    - `gateway.k8s.orb.local`
    - `brokermain0.gateway.k8s.orb.local`
    - `brokermain1.gateway.k8s.orb.local`
    - `brokermain2.gateway.k8s.orb.local`
    - In the future, as brokers are added or subtracted, `*.gateway.k8s.orb.local` as needed
- Gateway's TLS certificate must include SANs so that it can be trusted by the client when it presents itself as different brokers. Wildcard SAN is easiest, which in this example is `*.gateway.k8s.orb.local`.
- Since we are using an external load balancer, we do not need to use Gateway's internal load balancing mechanism. The external load balancer will distribute load.

## Appendix

### kcat commands

The interaction between kcat and OrbStack's ingress controller is a bit buggy. Connections often drop.

```bash
kcat -L -b franz-kafka.conduktor.svc.cluster.local:9092 \
    -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanism=PLAIN \
    -X sasl.password=admin-secret -X sasl.username=admin \
    -X ssl.ca.location=./certs/snakeoil-ca-1.crt
```

```bash
kcat -L -b gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
    -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanism=PLAIN \
    -X sasl.password=admin-secret -X sasl.username=admin \
    -X ssl.ca.location=./certs/snakeoil-ca-1.crt
```

```bash
echo "hello1" | kcat -t test -P -b gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
    -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanism=PLAIN \
    -X sasl.password=admin-secret -X sasl.username=admin \
    -X ssl.ca.location=./certs/snakeoil-ca-1.crt
```

```bash
kcat -t test -C -b gateway.k8s.orb.local:9092 \
    -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanism=PLAIN \
    -X sasl.password=admin-secret -X sasl.username=admin \
    -X ssl.ca.location=./certs/snakeoil-ca-1.crt
```
